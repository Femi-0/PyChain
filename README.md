# PyChain

## Introduction

A simple blockchain emulator visualized in streamlit, that:
- accepts for transaction, user inputs: sender, receipient, amount 
- creates a block with the transaction and adds it to a PyChain (blockchain instance)
- presents a table with the pychain
- allows for the validation of the displayed blockchain

## To emulate

clone the repo and run the following command:

    streamlit run app
